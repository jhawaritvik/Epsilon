Autonomous Research System – Agent Flow & Structure

## 🎯 Goal of the System

Conduct **end-to-end research** on a topic:

- explore literature & ideas
- form hypotheses
- implement experiments (via Jupyter)
- analyze results
- iterate until quality threshold is met

---

## 🧠 Core Agents (WHO does WHAT)

### 1️⃣ Research Exploration Agent

**Role**

- Understand the research topic
- Explore background concepts
- Identify gaps, hypotheses, or promising directions

**Inputs**

- Research question / domain
- Previous iteration context (if any)

**Outputs**

- Research plan
- Hypotheses
- Key metrics to evaluate
- Suggested experiments

**Tools**

- Web search / paper search
- PDF reader
- Notes memory (vector store)

---

### 2️⃣ Experiment Design Agent

**Role**

- Convert research ideas into **concrete experiments**
- Decide datasets, baselines, metrics

**Inputs**

- Hypotheses from Research Agent

**Outputs**

- Experiment specification
    - model type
    - dataset
    - evaluation protocol
    - expected outcomes

**Tools**

- Dataset catalog
- Config templates
- Prior experiment memory

---

### 3️⃣ Code & Notebook Agent

**Role**

- Implement experiments
- Modify code iteratively
- Work **inside a Jupyter notebook**

**Inputs**

- Experiment specification
- Feedback from Evaluation Agent

**Outputs**

- Executable notebook cells
- Training scripts
- Visualizations

**Tools**

- Jupyter kernel (critical)
- Python execution
- PyTorch / NumPy / plotting
- File system access

✅ This agent **does not decide if results are good**

---

### 4️⃣ Execution Agent (Non-LLM / Tool Agent)

**Role**

- Run notebook cells
- Capture logs, metrics, plots
- Handle crashes / exceptions

**Inputs**

- Notebook from Code Agent

**Outputs**

- Raw results
- Error traces
- Metrics artifacts

**Tools**

- Jupyter execution
- GPU / CPU
- Runtime monitor

⚠️ This is often **not an LLM**, just a tool wrapper.

---

### 5️⃣ Evaluation & Decision Agent

**Role**

- Critically evaluate research progress and outputs
- Judge **quality, correctness, and usefulness** of results
- Recommend the **next research action**
- Enforce stopping and iteration criteria

> This agent thinks and judges — it does not act or execute.
> 

---

**Inputs**

- Evaluation artifacts
    - Metrics (loss curves, accuracy, error norms, etc.)
    - Plots / logs
    - Experiment summaries
- Research context
    - Original problem statement
    - Hypothesis / objective
    - Expected theoretical behavior
- Iteration metadata
    - Current iteration number
    - Previous decisions

---

**Outputs**

- **Quality score / verdict**
    - e.g. `promising`, `inconclusive`, `failed`, `satisfactory`
- **Decision recommendation**
    - iterate code implementation
    - refine method / hypothesis
    - run new experiment
    - stop and summarize findings
- **Rationale**
    - What worked
    - What failed
    - Why the next step is justified

---

**Tools**

- Evaluation rubric
    - correctness
    - empirical signal vs noise
    - theoretical consistency
    - reproducibility
- Threshold rules
    - minimum improvement
    - max iterations
    - diminishing returns detection
- Comparison memory
    - previous experiment results
    - trend tracking

---

## 🧭 Control Layer (HOW things flow)

### Controller (Python / LangGraph)

**Responsibilities**

- Maintain global state
- Route outputs between agents
- Enforce iteration limits
- Prevent infinite loops

**State Example**

```json
{
"iteration":3,
"hypothesis":"...",
"quality_score":0.71,
"max_iterations":8,
"status":"iterate"
}
```

❗ This is **NOT an agent**

❗ This is **deterministic control**

---

## 🔁 High-Level Flow (SEQUENCE)

1. Research Exploration Agent
2. Experiment Design Agent
3. Code & Notebook Agent
4. Execution Agent
5. Evaluation & Decision Agent
6. Controller decides:
    - loop back to (2) or (3)
    - or terminate
