goal: "Does L2 regularization reduce variance compared to capacity reduction?"
expected:
  data_modality: tabular
  dataset_family: sklearn
  execution_mode: validation
  min_artifacts: 6
  allowed_failure_types: []
  statistical_test: t-test_ind
  model_family: neural_network

description: |
  This test verifies that the pipeline correctly handles a comparison between
  two variance reduction strategies: L2 regularization vs capacity reduction.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Design Agent should create a specification comparing two conditions
  - Execution Agent should use sklearn tabular dataset
  - Both baseline and treatment should train successfully
  - Evaluation Agent should run t-test
  - All required artifacts should be generated
  - Memory should record the finding appropriately
