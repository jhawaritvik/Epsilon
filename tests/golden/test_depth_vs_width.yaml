goal: "Does network depth improve accuracy more than width for image classification?"
expected:
  data_modality: vision
  dataset_family: torchvision
  execution_mode: validation
  min_artifacts: 6
  allowed_failure_types: []
  statistical_test: t-test_ind
  model_family: convolutional_network

description: |
  This test verifies that the pipeline correctly handles vision tasks and
  neural architecture comparisons.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Design Agent should recognize this as a vision task
  - Execution Agent should use torchvision dataset (MNIST or CIFAR)
  - Two architectures should be compared: deep-narrow vs shallow-wide
  - Evaluation Agent should run appropriate statistical test
  - All vision-specific artifacts should be generated (plots showing images)
  - No modality violations should occur
